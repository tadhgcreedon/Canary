Canary
======

An OS X to-do list that sorts tasks by effort and priority.

Installation:

//there is no dmg yet. wait for release 1.0!



Using Canary:

At first, Canary will open with a blank notepad, to which you can add tasks using the 'New Task' button,
and delete tasks via the 'Edit Tasks' button. By entering preferences, you can:
   
    - indicate whether you are a morning lark (tasks sort by most challenging in the morning, 
    least challenging later in the day), or a night owl (vice versa) -> not yet implemented
   
    - pick a theme for Canary
   
    - toggle notifications on/off -> not yet implemented.



Support:

If Canary is doing something it isn't supposed to, its functionality is confusing or if you love it,
feel free to send me an email at creedon@cs.dal.ca.
